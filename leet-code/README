If a problem's name in leetcode is "Palindrome Partitioning II",
then all words are connected by "_", so the source code name is
"Palindrome_Partitioning_II", and the suffix is the source
code type, if it's cpp file, then the total source code name is
"Palindrome_Partitioning_II.cpp".

It's very normal if a source code file cannot be compiled locally,
it is supposed to run in leetcode console: http://leetcode.com/onlinejudge .

If you still want to compile it localy, some minor modifications
need to be done. It depends on the source code file.
