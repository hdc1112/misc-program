fread issue:
how does fread really work? Song Jiang said there's no prefetch in fread, 
and there's no round-up. However, I observed them in strace log. dig into it

do strace profiling to applications for wormup:
zlib(done), clamav(done), picasso in linux(?)
PVFS stripe(?)
FDS in cloud computing(?)

set up a private git repository:

write a program taking strace log as input to calculate the head size:
zlib(manually done), clamav(?)

how much influence does process context switch have on strace log's integrity?:

what's the difference between PVFS and NFS, GFS?:

what is a thumbnail for pic?:
