- 1.0 release - code has been stable for a while now.

Version 0.1.9 (8/21/2002)
- Fix usage; "|" wasn't quoted correctly.


Version 0.1.8 (8/12/2002)
- Don't force the port to 22 if not specified; we might be using a
  ~/.ssh/config section that forces the port in that section.
- Added a "-t OPENSSH|COMSSH2|COMSSH1" command line option to force the
  server protocol in case of nc autodetect failure.

  Mitch!

Version 0.1.3 (5/19/2001)
- Minor cosmetic fixes.
- Merge ssh commands together so that the user has fewer passwords to enter.


Version 0.1.2 (4/15/2001)
- More combinations tested.  Still some to go...
- -v now fails to enter an infinite loop from a missing shift.
- Don't add duplicate line to "identification"
- Message at the end showing how to test if install worked.
- First of three fixes to use a temporary auth file, needed because the 
  once the ssh key is in place with an optional forced command, we lose
  the ability to run real commands with a password.
- Use REMPORT on all ssh's and scp's.
- Avoid using ~ as local and remote machine won't agree if different
  usernames are used.
- Use "Command " instead of "Command=" for commercial ssh.
- First freshmeat release.

Version 0.1 (4/9/2001)
- basic functionality in place for ssh1, ssh2, openssh, but not tested.
- checks for needed utils
- remote command, port, server, and username CLP's, as well as help and verbose.
- detects client and server versions from ssh -V and netcatting to server.
- creates local key if needed.
- makes required directories and files on server.
