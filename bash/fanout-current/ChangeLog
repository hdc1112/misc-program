V0.6.1 1/15/2003
- fanterm renamed to fanmux, fansetup* renamed to fanterm*.  Reset main
  console on exit.  Make pipes with mode 600.  Real packaging.


V0.6 1/12/2003
- Fanterm is now character oriented (and rewritten in perl) so it can
  even run interactive commands such as editors.  Added a "geometry"
  parameter to fansetup so you can specify how large the resulting
  xterms should be.  Clean up pipes on exit.  Fanterm renamed to
  fanterm.sh - this will be abandoned as the perl version's better.


V0.5 12/2/2002
- Added fanterm and fansetup, the first pass at an interactive version
  of fanout.  They actually function reasonably well, with the
  limitation that they're line oriented, so nothing is sent to the
  remote systems until a complete line of text is entered.  Perfectly
  good for shell commands, not so hot for character-at-a-time editing.


V0.4 8/7/2002
- Added the --noping option to avoid pinging any of the target hosts. 
  Good if one or more machines are up but can't be pinged because of an
  intervening firewall.

V0.3 9/16/2001
- Addition of documentation
